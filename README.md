# Node Fault Detection and Intelligent Data Re-routing

This repo contains the code for an exploratory project done as part of the course curriculum. The aim was to develop a system capable of detecting faults in network nodes and re-routing data intelligently to ensure continuous and efficient network communication.

## Project Description

In distributed networks, node failures can disrupt data transmission and degrade performance. Our project addresses this issue by implementing a fault detection mechanism that monitors the health of network nodes. Upon detecting a fault, the system dynamically recalculates data paths to bypass the faulty node and maintain optimal network performance.

### Key Features

- **Node Monitoring**: Continuously checks the status of each network node.
- **Fault Detection**: Identifies node failures and triggers the re-routing process.
- **Intelligent Re-routing**: Calculates new data paths to ensure seamless communication.
